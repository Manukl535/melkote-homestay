Melukote is an ancient temple-town perched on the rocky Yadugiri hill overlooking the Kaveri valley in Mandya district, Karnataka. The name Melukote literally means upper fort — deriving from “Melu” (top) and “Kote” (fort) — because the settlement grew around a fortified hill site. Evidence such as megalithic burials and line drawings on boulders suggests that the Yadugiri range was inhabited by prehistoric communities long before the historic temple town emerged. Local folklore also refers to Melukote by ancient names like Narayanadri, Vedadri and Yatishaila across the yugas of Hindu cosmology, indicating its deep mythological associations.

The town’s recorded religious prominence truly began in the 11th–12th century CE with the arrival of Sri Ramanujacharya, the seminal Vaishnavite philosopher and founder of the Vishishtadvaita school. After facing persecution in the Tamil region, Ramanuja traveled along the Kaveri and settled in Melukote, where, according to tradition, Lord Vishnu appeared to him in a dream and revealed the location of sacred clay used for the urdhva pundra (Vaishnava tilak). Guided by this vision, Ramanuja uncovered a lost vigraha (idol) of Vishnu and established the town as a centre of Srivaishnava worship, instituting ritual practices that continue to this day.

At the heart of Melukote’s spiritual landscape is the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple (also called Thirunarayanapuram), dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his form of Tirunarayana or Cheluvanarayana Swamy. While local legend and temple tradition describe the metallic utsavamurti (festival idol) as having been worshipped by Rama, Krishna, and other divine figures across ages, epigraphic evidence recorded in the Mysore Archaeological Department indicates that the deity was already revered long before Ramanuja’s arrival in 1098 CE — suggesting that Ramanuja restored or revitalized an existing shrine rather than creating it from scratch.

The temple complex that stands today was built and expanded over centuries through royal patronage. During the Vijayanagara Empire, the gopura and temple halls were enhanced, while the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore became ardent supporters of the shrine. King Raja Wodeyar I (r. late 16th–early 17th century) granted the temple large estates and gifted the first Rajamudi — a jewelled crown that became a symbol of ritual splendor. Later, his successors, including Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, contributed additional crowns and offerings that are still used in festivals today. Some accounts also suggest that Tipu Sultan made symbolic contributions such as a drum or other offerings, illustrating the complex historical interactions between rulers and temple institutions.

Beyond the main shrine at the foothills, Melukote’s Yoga Narasimha Temple on the hilltop stands as another historic landmark. Although largely a later construction built during the Hoysala period, it has legendary roots — some traditions tie the site to Prahlada’s penance and worship of Narasimha, marking it as one of the seven holy centres of Narasimha devotion in South India.

Alongside its temples, Melukote also became a renowned centre of scholarship and Sanskrit learning. The Academy of Sanskrit Research was established in the 19th century to preserve ancient manuscripts and promote traditional learning, reflecting the town’s continuous scholarly legacy.

Over the centuries, Melukote developed as an agrahara settlement — traditional Brahmin quarters supporting temple culture — and has preserved many of its ancient rituals, poetry, music, and religious festivals. The Vairamudi Brahmotsava, where the jewelled crown is ceremonially placed on the deity and drawn through the town in procession, attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees each year.

Today, Melukote remains a living testament to its layered past: a prehistoric habitation site, a seat of medieval devotional reform, a royal endowment centre, and a thriving temple town preserving India’s Vaishnava heritage for more than a millennium.
